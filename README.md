# inventory-management
## About This Project
This project was an assignment for my college in which I have created an web app to manage various products, categories and transactions in an inventory. 
I have used spring MVC model and used thymeleaf with html pages to handle front-end data. I have also used some bootstrap properties to design the webpages.
